## Roadmap:
- [x] making simple java socket application (client & server)
- [ ] making simple golang socket application (client & server)
- [ ] making simple rust socket application (client & server)

> after testing all socket apps, gonna connect them together:

- [ ] connect java client to golang server
- [ ] connect golang client to rust server
- [ ] connect rust client to java server
- [ ] connect java server to server node for sending final result
